            The person that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shows a great amount of courage</li>
            <li>Motivate others to be a better person</li>
            <li>Has enlighted thousands of people with her generous acts of kindness</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>
          Something that stands out to me the most of what she has done is Ellens greatest night of giveawyas. This is an event that she does every year around the holidays. She finds families that are in need or something tramatic happened to them and then she helps them in many ways. This is just one of many things that she does to help the community. Ellen has inspired me to be able to make light out of every situation.
